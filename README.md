# picturescraper
Mandatory ChatGPT test - a picture scrapes that downloads all the pictures from a specific urls and all its linked urls (from the same domain)

Idea came from a homepage that my brother found where one of our school teachers has apparently uploaded lots of pictures from school trips that we did in our childhood.

usage:
python scraper.py --url [url to parse, scheme + host]
