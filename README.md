# picturescraper
Mandatory ChatGPT test - a picture scrapes that downloads all the pictures from a specific urls and all its linked urls (from the same domain)

The idea came from a homepage that my brother found where one of our school teachers has apparently uploaded lots of pictures from school trips that we did in our childhood.
I hadn't really used python before that much before so this was a fun way to learn it and get something done quickly.

Came quite far with ChatGPT's help but refined along the way and added saving files into proper folders later.

usage:
python scraper.py --url [url to parse, scheme + host]
